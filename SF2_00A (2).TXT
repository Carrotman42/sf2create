                            1  Introduction

1.1  Scope and Intended Purpose of this Document

This document is the definitive source for the SoundFont 2 standard.
This document should provide complete and accurate information to
allow any user to correctly construct and interpret SoundFont 2
compatible banks.  This document is not intended to provide any
information on the design or implementation of music synthesizers.


1.2  Document Organization

This document is organized such that sections 1 and 2 give
introductory information about the SoundFont 2 standard.  Both new and
seasoned musical engineers will get value from the review of
terminology provided in section 2.  Sections 3 through 8 provide
increasingly detailed descriptions of the SoundFont 2 standard data
structures.  The sections will ultimately serve as reference, but can
be scanned in order to provide sufficient detail for any level of
understanding.  Section 9 deals with the Synthesis model supported by
the SoundFont standard, and will be of interest to anyone involved
with the synthesis engine or bank creation.  Section 10 specifies
error handling when dealing with SoundFont compatible banks, and will
be of interest primarily to programmers using the SoundFont standard.
The alphabetical glossary in section 11 can be used as a reference for
any unfamiliar or confusing terminology.


1.3  SoundFont 2 Objectives

The SoundFont 2 standard is intended to provide an extensible,
portable, universal interchange format for wavetable synthesizer
OsamplesO and articulation data.  The standard is made extensible
largely by the use of enumerated OgeneratorsO and OmodulatorsO so that
additional function units can be added as requirements dictate.  The
standard is made portable and universal by the use of precisely
defined and hardware independent parameters, as well as by specific
practices designed to provide support to a broad range of
technologies.


1.4  SoundFont 1.x

The SoundFont standard was originally released in its 1.0 embodiment
with the Creative Technology AWE32 product using the EMU8000 music
synthesis chip.  This proprietary format proved very successful, but
experience brought a number of refinements.  These initially were
performed in an upward compatible manner to revision 1.5.

However, due to increasing demand for a public downloadable sound
interchange format, Creative Technology determined that a public
disclosure of the SoundFont format would be in its best interest.
Because there were still more improvements required, many of which
could not be supported in a completely compatible manner, Creative
decided to combine public disclosure with the step to a revised
format.  The result is the SoundFont 2 standard.

There are several key enhancements contained in the SoundFont 2
standard.  The first is the use of relative parameters in the Preset
level.  This allows instruments to be adjusted without altering their
self-consistency, providing easy and effective user editing of
instruments.  The second is an improvement in the data structures
associated with the samples themselves, again providing key
information which will allow the sound designer to re-use samples with
a minimum of difficulty.  An increased specificity in the rules for
sample data produces enhanced portability across various sound
engines.  Finally, the addition of modulators produces a robust
structure which can express all the typical function in current and
future wavetable synthesizers.


1.5  Future Enhancements to the SoundFont 2 Standard

The SoundFont 2 standard is designed to allow for enhancements based
on future wavetable synthesis technology capabilities by additional
enumerations of generators and modulators.  This will be done as
required in an upwardly compatible manner.  Suggestions for additions
can be made via e-mail to soundfont@emu.com.  In general, our policy
for updating the specification will be based on consumer need, rather
than technological idealism.

It is our expectation to maintain bidirectional compatibility within
the SoundFont 2 standard for some years.

interchangably with frequency.

pitch shift - A change in pitch.  Wavetable synthesis relies on
interpolators to cause pitch shift in a sample to produce the notes of

Additional timbral adjustments are often made to the sound thus
produced using amplifiers, filters, and effect processing such as
reverb and chorus.

                           3  RIFF Structure

3.1  General RIFF File Structure

The RIFF (Resource Interchange File Format) is a tagged file structure
developed for multimedia resource files, and is described in some
detail in the Microsoft Windows 3.1 SDK Multimedia ProgrammerOs
Reference.  the Tagged-file structure is useful because it helps
prevent compatibility problems which can occur as the file definition
changes over time.  Because each piece of data in the file is
identified by a standard header, an application that does not
recognize a given data element can skip over the unknown information.

A RIFF file is constructed from a basic building block called a
Ochunk.O  In OCO syntax, a chunk is defined:

typedef DWORD FOURCC;         //  Four-character code

typedef struct {
     FOURCC    ckID;          //  A chunk ID identifies the type of
data within the chunk.
     DWORD     ckSize;        //  The size of the chunk data in bytes,
excluding any pad byte.
     BYTE      ckDATA[ckSize];     //  The actual data plus a pad byte
if reqOd to word align.
};

Two types of chunks, the ORIFFO and OLISTO chunks, may contain nested
chunks called subchunks as their data.

The ordering requirements of chunks and subchunks within a RIFF file
is not well documented in the RIFF file format.  In SoundFont 2.0, the
order of the subchunks withing the INFO chunk is arbitrary, but for
consistency it is recommended that the subchunks be ordered as
presented in this document.  The order of the all other chunks and
subchunks is strictly defined and must be maintained as presented in
this document.


3.2  The SoundFont 2 Chunks and Subchunks

A SoundFont 2 compatible RIFF file comprises three chunks:  an INFO-
list chunk containing a number of required and optional subchunks
describing the file, its history, and its intended use, an sdta-list
chunk comprising a single subchunk containing any referenced digital
audio samples, and a pdta-list chunk containing nine subchunks which
define the articulation of the digital audio data.

The SoundFont 2 standard allows that the subchunks within the INFO-
list chunk may appear in arbitrary order.  However, the order of the
three chunks, and the order of the subchunks within the pdta-list
chunk, is fixed.

The SoundFont 2 specification requires that implementations ignore
unknown subchunks within the INFO-list chunk.  Note, however, that
until such subchunks become defined in the specification, inclusion of
additional INFO-list subchunks will preclude the file from conforming
to the SoundFont standard.

A detailed description of the SoundFont 2 RIFF structure is provided
in Section 4.


3.3  Redundancy and Error Handling in the RIFF structure

The RIFF file structure contains redundant information regarding the
length of the file and the length of the chunks and subchunks.  This
fact enables any reader of a SoundFont compatible file to determine if
the file has been damaged by loss of data.

If any such loss is detected, the SoundFont compatible file is termed
Ostructurally unsoundO and in general should be rejected.  SoundFont
compatible software developers may produce utilities to recover data
from structurally unsound files, producing with or without user
assitance a corrected and structurally sound SoundFont 2 compatible
file.

4.5 SoundFont 2 RIFF File Format Type Definitions

The sfModulator, sfGenerator, and sfTransform types are all
enumeration types whose values are defined in subsequent sections.

The genAmountType is a union which allows signed 16 bit, unsigned 16
bit, and two unsigned 8 bit fields:

typedef struct
   {
   BYTE byLo;
   BYTE byHi;
   } rangesType;

typedef union
   {
   rangesType ranges;
   SHORT shAmount;
   WORD wAmount;
   } genAmountType;

The SFSampleLink is an enumeration type which describes both the type
of sample (mono, stereo left, etc.) and the whether the sample is
located in RAM or ROM memory:

typedef enum
   {
   monoSample = 1,
   rightSample = 2,
   leftSample = 4,
   linkedSample = 8,
   RomMonoSample = 0x8001,
   RomRightSample = 0x8002,
   RomLeftSample = 0x8004,
   RomLinkedSample = 0x8008
   } SFSampleLink;


                        5  The INFO-list Chunk

TheINFO-list chunk in a SoundFont 2 compatible file contains three
mandatory and a variety of optional subchunks as defined below.  The
INFO-list chunk gives basic information about the SoundFont compatible
bank contained in the file.


5.1  The ifil Subchunk

The ifil subchunk is a mandatory subchunk identifying the SoundFont
specification version level to which the file complies.  It is always
four bytes in length, and contains data according to the structure:

struct sfVersionTag
{
     WORD wMajor;
     WORD wMinor;
};

The WORD wMajor contains the value to the left of the decimal point in
the SoundFont specification version, the WORD wMinor contains the
value to the right of the decimal point.  For example, version 2.11
would be implied if wMajor=2 and wMinor=11.

These values can be used by applications which read SoundFont
compatible files to determine if the format of the file is usable by
the program.  Within a fixed wMajor, the only changes to the format
will be the addition of Generator, Source and Transform enumerators,
and additional info subchunks.  These are all defined as being ignored
if unknown to the program.  Consequently, many applications can be
designed to be fully upward compatible within a given wMajor.  In the
case of editors or other programs in which all enumerators should be
known, the value of wMinor may be of consequence.  Generally the
application program will either accept the file as usable (possibly
with appropriate transparent translation), reject the file as
unusable, or warn the user that there may be uneditable data in the
file.

If the ifil subchunk is missing, or its size is not four bytes, the
file should be rejected as structurally unsound.


5.2  The isng Subchunk

The isng subchunk is a mandatory subchunk identifying the wavetable
sound engine for which the file was optimized.  It contains an ASCII
string of 256 or fewer bytes including one or two terminators of value
zero, so as to make the total byte count even.  The default isng field
is the eight bytes representing OEMU8000O as seven ASCII characters
followed by a zero byte.

The ASCII should be treated as case-sensitive.  In other words
Oemu8000O is not the same as OEMU8000.O

The isng string can be optionally used by chip drivers to vary their
synthesis algorithms to emulate the target sound engine.

If the isng subchunk is missing, not terminated in a zero valued byte,
or its contents are an unknown sound engine, the field should be
ignored and EMU8000 assumed.


5.3  The INAM Subchunk

The INAM subchunk is a mandatory subchunk providing the name of the
SoundFont compatible bank.  It contains an ASCII string of 256 or
fewer bytes including one or two terminators of value zero, so as to
make the total byte count even.  A typical inam subchunk would be the
fourteen bytes representing OGeneral MIDIO as twelve ASCII characters
followed by two zero bytes.

The ASCII should be treated as case-sensitive.  In other words
OGeneral MIDIO is not the same as OGENERAL MIDI.O

The inam string is typically used for the idenitification of banks
even if the file names are altered.

If the inam subchunk is missing, or not terminated in a zero valued
byte, the field should be ignored and the user supplied with an
appropriate error message if the name is queried.  If the file is re-
written, a valid name should be placed in the INAM field.


5.4  The irom Subchunk

The irom subchunk is an optional subchunk identifying a particular
wavetable sound data ROM to which any ROM samples refer.  It contains
an ASCII string of 256 or fewer bytes including one or two terminators
of value zero, so as to make the total byte count even.  A typical
irom field would be the six bytes representing O1MGMO as four ASCII
characters followed by two zero bytes.

The ASCII should be treated as case-sensitive.  In other words O1mgmO
is not the same as O1MGM.O

The irom string is used by drivers to verify that the ROM data
referenced by the file is available to the sound engine.

If the irom subchunk is missing, not terminated in a zero valued byte,
or its contents are an unknown ROM, the field should be ignored and
the file assumed to reference no ROM samples.  If ROM samples are
accessed, any accesses to such intruments should be terminated and not
sound.  A file should not be written which attempts to access ROM
samples without both irom and iver present and valid.


5.5  The iver Subchunk

The iver subchunk is an optional subchunk identifying the particular
wavetable sound data ROM revision to which any ROM samples refer.  It
is always four bytes in length, and contains data according to the
structure:

struct sfVersionTag
{
     WORD wMajor;
     WORD wMinor;
};

The WORD wMajor contains the value to the left of the decimal point in
the ROM version, the WORD wMinor contains the value to the right of
the decimal point.  For example, version 1.36 would be implied if
wMajor=1 and wMinor=36.

The iver subchunk is used by drivers to verify that the ROM data
referenced by the file is located in the exact locations specified by
the sound headers.

If the iver subchunk is missing, not four bytes in length, or its
contents indicate an unknown or incorrect ROM, the field should be
ignored and the file assumed to reference no ROM samples.  If ROM
samples are accessed, any accesses to such instruments should be
terminated and not sound.  Note that for ROM samples to function
correctly, both iver and irom must be present and valid.  A file
should not be written which attempts to access ROM samples without
both irom and iver present and valid.


5.6  The ICRD Subchunk

The ICRD subchunk is an optional subchunk identifying the creation
date of the SoundFont compatible bank.  It contains an ASCII string of
256 or fewer bytes including one or two terminators of value zero, so
as to make the total byte count even.  A typical ICRD field would be
the twelve bytes representing OMay 1, 1995O as eleven ASCII characters
followed by a zero byte.

Conventionally, the format of the string is OMonth Day, YearO where
Month is initially capitalized and is the conventional full English
spelling of the month, Day is the date in decimal followed by a comma,
and Year is the full decimal year.  Thus the field should
conventionally never be longer than 32 bytes.

The ICRD string is provided for library management purposes.

If the ICRD subchunk is missing, not terminated in a zero valued byte,
or for some reason incapable of being faithfully copied as an ASCII
string, the field should be ignored and if re-written, should not be
copied.  If the fieldOs contents are not seemingly meaningful but can
faithfully reproduced, this should be done.


5.7  The IENG Subchunk

The IENG subchunk is an optional subchunk identifying the names of any
sound designers or engineers responsible for the SoundFont compatible
bank.  It contains an ASCII string of 256 or fewer bytes including one
or two terminators of value zero, so as to make the total byte count
even.  A typical IENG field would be the twelve bytes representing
OTim SwartzO as ten ASCII characters followed by two zero bytes.

The IENG string is provided for library management purposes.

If the IENG subchunk is missing, not terminated in a zero valued byte,
or for some reason incapable of being faithfully copied as an ASCII
string, the field should be ignored and if re-written, should not be
copied.  If the fieldOs contents are not seemingly meaningful but can
faithfully reproduced, this should be done.


5.8  The IPRD Subchunk

The IPRD subchunk is an optional subchunk identifying any specific
product for which the SoundFont compatible bank is intended.  It
contains an ASCII string of 256 or fewer bytes including one or two
terminators of value zero, so as to make the total byte count even.  A
typical IPRD field would be the eight bytes representing OSBAWE32O as
seven ASCII characters followed by a zero byte.

The ASCII should be treated as case-sensitive.  In other words
Osbawe32O is not the same as OSBAWE32.O

The IPRD string is provided for library management purposes.

If the IPRD subchunk is missing, not terminated in a zero valued byte,
or for some reason incapable of being faithfully copied as an ASCII
string, the field should be ignored and if re-written, should not be
copied.  If the fieldOs contents are not seemingly meaningful but can
faithfully reproduced, this should be done.


5.9  The ICOP Subchunk

The ICOP subchunk is an optional subchunk containing any copyright
assertion string associated with the SoundFont compatible bank.  It
contains an ASCII string of 256 or fewer bytes including one or two
terminators of value zero, so as to make the total byte count even.  A
typical ICOP field would be the 40 bytes representing OCopyright (c)
1995 E-mu Systems, Inc.O as 38 ASCII characters followed by two zero
bytes.

The ICOP string is provided for intellectual property protection and
management purposes.

If the ICOP subchunk is missing, not terminated in a zero valued byte,
or for some reason incapable of being faithfully copied as an ASCII
string, the field should be ignored and if re-written, should not be
copied.  If the fieldOs contents are not seemingly meaningful but can
faithfully reproduced, this should be done.


5.10  The ICMT Subchunk

The ICMT subchunk is an optional subchunk containing any comments
associated with the SoundFont compatible bank.  It contains an ASCII
string of 65,536 or fewer bytes including one or two terminators of
value zero, so as to make the total byte count even.  A typical ICMT
field would be the 40 bytes representing OThis space unintentionally
left blank.O as 38 ASCII characters followed by two zero bytes.

The ICMT string is provided for any non-scatological uses.

If the ICMT subchunk is missing, not terminated in a zero valued byte,
or for some reason incapable of being faithfully copied as an ASCII
string, the field should be ignored and if re-written, should not be
copied.  If the fieldOs contents are not seemingly meaningful but can
faithfully reproduced, this should be done.


5.11  The ISFT Subchunk

The ISFT subchunk is an optional subchunk identifying the SoundFont
compatible tools used to create and most recently modify the SoundFont
compatible bank.  It contains an ASCII string of 256 or fewer bytes
including one or two terminators of value zero, so as to make the
total byte count even.  A typical ISFT field would be the thirty bytes
representing OPreditor 2.00a:Preditor 2.00aO as twenty-nine ASCII
characters followed by a zero byte.

The ASCII should be treated as case-sensitive.  In other words
OPreditorO is not the same as OPREDITOR.O

Conventionally, the tool name and revision control number are included
first for the creating tool and then for the most recent modifying
tool.  The two strings are separated by a colon.  The string should be
produced by the creating program with a null modifying tool field
(e.g. OPreditor 2.00a:), and each time a tool modifies the bank, it
should replace the modifying tool field with its own name and revision
control number.

The ISFT string is provided primarily for error tracing purposes.

If the ISFT subchunk is missing, not terminated in a zero valued byte,
or for some reason incapable of being faithfully copied as an ASCII
string, the field should be ignored and if re-written, should not be
copied.  If the fieldOs contents are not seemingly meaningful but can
faithfully reproduced, this should be done.


                        6  The sdta-list Chunk

The sdta-list chunk in a SoundFont 2 compatible file contains a single
optional smpl subchunk which contains all the RAM based sound data
associated with the SoundFont compatible bank.  The smpl subchunk is
of arbitrary length, and contains an even number of bytes.


6.1  Sample Data Format in the smpl Subchunk

The smpl subchunk, if present, contains one or more "samples" of
digital audio information in the form of linearly coded sixteen bit,
signed, little endian (least significant byte first) words.  Each
sample is followed by a minimum of forty-six zero valued sample data
points.  These zero valued data points are necessary to guarantee that
any reasonable upward pitch shift using any reasonable interpolator
can loop on zero data at the end of the sound.


6.2  Sample Data Looping Rules

Within each sample, one or more loop point pairs may exist.  The
locations of these points are defined within the pdta-list chunk, but
the sample data points themselves must comply with certain practices
in order for the loop to be compatible across multiple platforms.

The loops are defined by "equivalent points" in the sample.  This
means that there are two sample data points which are logically
equivalent, and a loop occurs when these points are spliced atop one
another.  In concept, the loop end point is never actually played
during looping; instead the loop start point follows the point just
prior to the loop end point.  Because of the bandlimited nature of
digital audio sampling, an artifact free loop will exhibit virtually
identical data surrounding the equivalent points.

In actuality, because of the various interpolation algorithms used by
wavetable synthesizers, the data surrounding both the loop start and
end points may affect the sound of the loop.  Hence both the loop
start and end points must be surrounded by continuous audio data.  For
example, even if the sound is programmed to continue to loop
throughout the decay, sample data points must be provided beyond the
loop end point.  This data will typically be identical to the data at
the start of the loop.  A minimum of eight valid data points are
required to be present before the loop start and after the loop end.

The eight data points (four on each side) surrounding the two
equivalent loop points should also be forced to be identical.  By
forcing the data to be identical, all interpolation algorithms are
guaranteed to properly reproduce an artifact-free loop.


                        7  The pdta-list Chunk

7.1  The HYDRA Data Structure

The articulation data within a SoundFont 2 compatible file is
contained in nine subchunks, named OhydraO after the mythical nine-
headed beast.  The structure has been designed for interchange
purposes; it is not optimized for either run-time synthesis nor for on-
the-fly editing.  It is reasonable and proper for SoundFont compatible
client programs to translate to and from the hydra structure as they
read and write SoundFont compatible files.


7.2  The PHDR Subchunk

The PHDR subchunk is a required subchunk listing all presets within
the SoundFont compatible file.  It is always a multiple of thirty
eight bytes in length, and contains a minimum of two records, one
record for each preset and one for a terminal record according to the
structure:

struct sfPresetHeader
{
     CHAR achPresetName[20];
     WORD wPreset;
     WORD wBank;
     WORD wPresetBagNdx;
     DWORD dwLibrary;
     DWORD dwGenre;
     DWORD dwMorphology;
};

The ASCII character field achPresetName contains the name of the
preset expressed in ASCII, with unused terminal characters filled with
zero valued bytes.  Preset names are case-sensitive.  A unique name
should  always be assigned to each preset in the SoundFont compatible
bank to enable identification.  However, if a bank is read containing
the erroneous state of presets with identical names, the presets
should not be discarded.  They should either be preserved as read or
preferentially uniquely renamed.

The WORD wPreset contains the MIDI Preset Number and the WORD wBank
contains the MIDI Bank Number which apply to this preset.  Note that
the presets are not ordered within the SoundFont compatible bank.
Presets should have a unique set of wPreset and wBank numbers.
However, if two presets have identical values of both wPreset and
wBank, the first occuring preset in the PHDR chunk is the active
preset, but any others with the same wBank and wPreset values should
be maintained so that they can be renumbered and used at a later time.
The special case of a General MIDI percussion bank is handled
conventionally by a wBank value of 128.  If the value in either field
is not a valid MIDI value of zero through 127, or 128 for wBank, the
preset cannot be played but should be maintained.

The WORD wPresetBagNdx is an index to the presetOs layer list in the
PBAG subchunk.  Because the preset layer list is in the same order as
the preset header list, the preset bag indicies will be monotonically
increasing with increasing preset headers.  The size of the PBAG
subchunk in bytes will be equal to four times the terminal presetOs
wPresetBagNdx plus four.  If the preset bag indicies are non-monotonic
or if the terminal presetOs wPresetBagNdx does not match the PBAG
subchunk size, the file is structurally defective and should be
rejected at load time.  All presets except the terminal preset must
have at least one layer; any preset with no layers should be ignored.

The DWORDs dwLibrary; dwGenre and dwMorphology are reserved for future
implementation in a preset library management function and should be
preserved as read, and created as zero.

The terminal sfPresetHeader record should never be accessed, and
exists only to provide a terminal wPresetBagNdx with which to
determine the number of layers in the last preset.  All other values
are conventionally zero, with the exception of achPresetName, which
can optionally be OEOPO indicating end of presets.

If the PHDR subchunk is missing, contains fewer than two records, or
its size is not a multiple of 38 bytes, the file should be rejected as
structurally unsound.


7.3  The PBAG Subchunk

The PBAG subchunk is a required subchunk listing all preset layers
within the SoundFont compatible file.  It is always a multiple of four
bytes in length, and contains one record for each preset layer plus
one record for a terminal layer according to the structure:

struct sfPresetBag
{
     WORD wGenNdx;
     WORD wModNdx;
};

The first layer in a given preset is located at that presetOs
wPresetBagNdx.  The number of layers in the preset is determined by
the difference between the next presetOs wPresetBagNdx and the current
wPresetBagNdx.

The WORD wGenNdx is an index to the presetOs layer list of generators
in the PGEN subchunk, and the wModNdx is an index to its list of
modulators in the PMOD subchunk.  Because both the generator and
modulator lists are in the same order as the preset header and layer
lists, these indicies will be monotonically increasing with increasing
preset layers.  The size of the PMOD subchunk in bytes will be equal
to ten times the terminal presetOs wModNdx plus ten and the size of
the PGEN subchunk in bytes will be equal to four times the terminal
presetOs wGenNdx plus four.  If the generator or modulator indicies
are non-monotonic or do not match the size of the respective PGEN or
PMOD subchunks, the file is structurally defective and should be
rejected at load time.

If a preset has more than one layer, the first layer may be a global
layer.  A global layer is determined by the fact that the last
generator in the list is not an Instrument generator.  All generator
lists must contain at least one generator with one exception - if a
global layer exists for which there are no generators but only
modulators.  The modulator lists can contain zero or more modulators.

If a layer other than the first layer lacks an Instrument generator as
its last generator, that layer should be ignored.  A global layer with
no modulators and no generators should also be ignored.

If the PBAG subchunk is missing, or its size is not a multiple of four
bytes, the file should be rejected as structurally unsound.


7.4  The PMOD Subchunk

The PMOD subchunk is a required subchunk listing all preset layer
modulators within the SoundFont compatible file.  It is always a
multiple of ten bytes in length, and contains zero or more modulators
plus a terminal record according to the structure:

struct sfModList
{
     SFModulator sfModSrcOper;
     SFGenerator sfModDestOper;
     SHORT modAmount;
     SFModulator sfModAmtSrcOper;
     SFTransform sfModTransOper;
};

The preset layer's wModNdx points to the first modulator for that
preset layer, and the number of modulators present for a preset layer
is determined by the difference between the next higher preset layer's
wModNdx and the current preset's wModNdx.  A difference of zero
indicates there are no modulators in this preset layer.

The sfModSrcOper is a value of one of the SFModulator enumeration type
values.  Unknown or undefined values are ignored.  This value
indicates the source of data for the modulator.

The sfModDestOper is a value of one of the SFGenerator enumeration
type values.  Unknown or undefined values are ignored.  This value
indicates the destination of the modulator.

The SHORT modAmount is a signed value indicating the degree to which
the source modulates the destination.  A zero value indicates there is
no fixed amount.

The sfModAmtSrcOper is a value of one of the SFModulator enumeration
type values.  Unknown or undefined values are ignored.  This value
indicates the degree to which the source modulates the destination is
to be controlled by the specified modulation source.

The sfModTransOper is a value of one of the SFTransform enumeration
type values.  Unknown or undefined values are ignored.  This value
indicates that a transform of the specified type will be applied to
the modulation source before application to the modulator.

The terminal record conventionally contains zero in all fields, and is
always ignored.

A modulator is defined by its sfModSrcOper, its sfModDestOper, and its
sfModSrcAmtOper.  All modulators within a layer must have a unique set
of these three enumerators.  If a second modulator is encountered with
the same three enumerators as a previous modulator with the same
layer, the first modulator will be ignored.

Modulators in the PMOD subchunk act as additively relative modulators
with respect to those in the IMOD subchunk.  In other words, a PMOD
modulator can increase or decrease the amount of an IMOD modulator.

In SoundFont 2.00, no modulators have yet been defined, and the PMOD
subchunk will always consist of ten zero valued bytes.

If the PMOD subchunk is missing, or its size is not a multiple of ten
bytes, the file should be rejected as structurally unsound.


7.5  The PGEN Subchunk

The PGEN chunk is a required chunk containing a list of preset layer
generators for each preset layer within the SoundFont compatible file.
It is always a multiple of four bytes in length, and contains one or
more generators for each preset layer (except a global layer
containing only modulators) plus a terminal record according to the
structure:

struct sfGenList
{
     SFGenerator sfGenOper;
     genAmountType genAmount;
};

where the types are defined:

typedef struct
{
     BYTE byLo;
     BYTE byHi;
} rangesType;

typedef union
{
     rangesType ranges;
     SHORT shAmount;
     WORD wAmount;
} genAmountType;

The sfGenOper is a value of one of the SFGenerator enumeration type
values.  Unknown or undefined values are ignored.  This value
indicates the type of generator being indicated.

The genAmount is the value to be assigned to the specified generator.
Note that this can be of three formats.  Certain generators specify a
range of MIDI key numbers of MIDI velocities, with a minimum and
maximum value.  Other generators specify an unsigned WORD value.  Most
generators, however, specify a signed 16 bit SHORT value.

The preset layer's wGenNdx points to the first generator for that
preset layer.  Unless the layer is a global layer, the last generator
in the list is an "Instrument" generator, whose value is a pointer to
the instrument associated with that layer.  If a Okey rangeO generator
exists for the preset layer, it is always the first generator in the
list for that preset layer.  If a Ovelocity rangeO generator exists
for the preset layer, it will only be preceded by a key range
generator.  If any generators follow an Instrument generator, they
will be ignored.

A generator is defined by its sfGenOper.  All generators within a
layer must have a unique sfGenOper enumerator.  If a second generator
is encountered with the same sfGenOper enumerator as a previous
generator with the same layer, the first generator will be ignored.

Generators in the PGEN subchunk are applied relative to generators in
the IGEN subchunk in an additve manner.  In other words, PGEN
generators increase or decrease the value of an IGEN generator.

If the PGEN subchunk is missing, or its size is not a multiple of four
bytes, the file should be rejected as structurally unsound.  If a key
range generator is present and not the first generator, it should be
ignored.  If a velocity range generator is present, and is preceded by
a generator other than a key range generator, it should be ignored.
If a non-global list does not end in an instrument generator, layer
should be ignored.  If the instrument generator value is equal to or
greater than the terminal instrument, the file should be rejected as
structurally unsound.


7.6  The INST Subchunk

The inst subchunk is a required subchunk listing all instruments
within the SoundFont compatible file.  It is always a multiple of
twenty two bytes in length, and contains a minimum of two records, one
record for each instrument and one for a terminal record according to
the structure:

struct sfInst
{
     CHAR achInstName[20];
     WORD wInstBagNdx;
};

The ASCII character field achInstName contains the name of the
instrument expressed in ASCII, with unused terminal characters filled
with zero valued bytes.  Instrument names are case-sensitive.  A
unique name should always be assigned to each instrument in the
SoundFont compatible bank to enable identification.  However, if a
bank is read containing the erroneous state of instruments with
identical names, the instruments should not be discarded.  They should
either be preserved as read or preferentially uniquely renamed.

The WORD wInstBagNdx is an index to the instrumentOs split list in the
IBAG subchunk.  Because the instrument split list is in the same order
as the instrument list, the instrument bag indicies will be
monotonically increasing with increasing instruments.  The size of the
IBAG subchunk in bytes will be four greater than four times the
terminal (EOI) instrumentOs wInstBagNdx.  If the instrument bag
indicies are non-monotonic or if the terminal instrumentOs wInstBagNdx
does not match the IBAG subchunk size, the file is structurally
defective and should be rejected at load time.  All instruments except
the terminal instrument must have at least one split; any preset with
no splits should be ignored.

The terminal sfInst record should never be accessed, and exists only
to provide a terminal wInstBagNdx with which to determine the number
of splits in the last instrument.  All other values are conventionally
zero, with the exception of achInstName, which should be OEOIO
indicating end of instruments.

If the INST subchunk is missing, contains fewer than two records, or
its size is not a multiple of 22 bytes, the file should be rejected as
structurally unsound.  All instruments present in the inst subchunk
are typically referenced by a preset layer.  However, a file
containing any OorphanedO instruments need not be rejected.  SoundFont
compatible applications can optionally ignore or filter out these
orphaned instruments based on user preference.


7.7  The IBAG Subchunk

The IBAG subchunk is a required subchunk listing all instrument splits
within the SoundFont compatible file.  It is always a multiple of four
bytes in length, and contains one record for each instrument split
plus one record for a terminal layer according to the structure:

struct sfInstBag
{
     WORD wInstGenNdx;
     WORD wInstModNdx;
};

The first split in a given instrument is located at that instrumentOs
wInstBagNdx.  The number of splits in the instrument is determined by
the difference between the next instrumentOs wInstBagNdx and the
current  wInstBagNdx.

The WORD wInstGenNdx is an index to the instrument splitOs list of
generators in the IGEN subchunk, and the wInstModNdx is an index to
its list of modulators in the IMOD subchunk.  Because both the
generator and modulator lists are in the same order as the instrument
and split lists, these indicies will be monotonically increasing with
increasing splits.  The size of the IMOD subchunk in bytes will be
equal to ten times the terminal instrumentOs wModNdx plus ten and the
size of the IGEN subchunk in bytes will be equal to four times the
terminal instrumentOs wGenNdx plus four.  If the generator or
modulator indicies are non-monotonic or do not match the size of the
respective IGEN or IMOD subchunks, the file is structurally defective
and should be rejected at load time.

If an instrument has more than one split, the first split may be a
global split.  A global split is determined by the fact that the last
generator in the list is not a sampleID generator.  All generator
lists must contain at least one generator with one exception - if a
global split exists for which there are no generators but only
modulators.  The modulator lists can contain zero or more modulators.

If a split other than the first split lacks a sampleID generator as
its last generator, that split should be ignored.  A global split with
no modulators and no generators should also be ignored.

If the IBAG subchunk is missing, or its size is not a multiple of four
bytes, the file should be rejected as structurally unsound.


7.8  The IMOD Subchunk

The IMOD subchunk is a required subchunk listing all instrument split
modulators within the SoundFont compatible file.  It is always a
multiple of ten bytes in length, and contains zero or more modulators
plus a terminal record according to the structure:

struct sfModList
{
     SFModulator sfModSrcOper;
     SFGenerator sfModDestOper;
     SHORT modAmount;
     SFModulator sfModAmtSrcOper;
     SFTransform sfModTransOper;
};

The splitOs wInstModNdx points to the first modulator for that split,
and the number of modulators present for a split is determined by the
difference between the next higher splitOs wInstModNdx and the current
split's wModNdx.  A difference of zero indicates there are no
modulators in this split.

The sfModSrcOper is a value of one of the SFModulator enumeration type
values.  Unknown or undefined values are ignored.  This value
indicates the source of data for the modulator.

The sfModDestOper is a value of one of the SFGenerator enumeration
type values.  Unknown or undefined values are ignored.  This value
indicates the destination of the modulator.

The SHORT modAmount is a signed value indicating the degree to which
the source modulates the destination.  A zero value indicates there is
no fixed amount.

The sfModAmtSrcOper is a value of one of the SFModulator enumeration
type values.  Unknown or undefined values are ignored.  This value
indicates the degree to which the source modulates the destination is
to be controlled by the specified modulation source.

The sfModTransOper is a value of one of the SFTransform enumeration
type values.  Unknown or undefined values are ignored.  This value
indicates that a transform of the specified type will be applied to
the modulation source before application to the modulator.

The terminal record conventionally contains zero in all fields, and is
always ignored.

A modulator is defined by its sfModSrcOper, its sfModDestOper, and its
sfModSrcAmtOper.  All modulators within a split must have a unique set
of these three enumerators.  If a second modulator is encountered with
the same three enumerators as a previous modulator with the same
split, the first modulator will be ignored.

Modulators in the IMOD subchunk are absolute.  This means that an IMOD
modulator replaces, rather than adding to, a default modulator.

In SoundFont 2.00, no modulators have yet been defined, and the IMOD
subchunk will always consist of ten zero valued bytes.

If the IMOD subchunk is missing, or its size is not a multiple of ten
bytes, the file should be rejected as structurally unsound.


7.9  The IGEN Subchunk

The IGEN chunk is a required chunk containing a list of split
generators for each instrument split within the SoundFont compatible
file.  It is always a multiple of four bytes in length, and contains
one or more generators for each split (except a globalsplit containing
only modulators) plus a terminal record according to the structure:

struct sfInstGenList
{
     SFGenerator sfGenOper;
     genAmountType genAmount;
};

where the types are defined as in the PGEN layer above.

The genAmount is the value to be assigned to the specified generator.
Note that this can be of three formats.  Certain generators specify a
range of MIDI key numbers of MIDI velocities, with a minimum and
maximum value.  Other generators specify an unsigned WORD value.  Most
generators, however, specify a signed 16 bit SHORT value.

The splitOs wInstGenNdx points to the first generator for that split.
Unless the split is a global split, the last generator in the list is
a "sampleID" generator, whose value is a pointer to the sample
associated with that split.  If a Okey rangeO generator exists for the
split, it is always the first generator in the list for that split.
If a Ovelocity rangeO generator exists for the split, it will only be
preceded by a key range generator.  If any generators follow a
sampleID generator, they will be ignored.

A generator is defined by its sfGenOper.  All generators within a
split must have a unique sfGenOper enumerator.  If a second generator
is encountered with the same sfGenOper enumerator as a previous
generator with the same split, the first generator will be ignored.

Generators in the IGEN subchunk are absolute in nature.  This means
that an IGEN generator replaces, rather than adding to, the default
value for the generator.

If the IGEN subchunk is missing, or its size is not a multiple of four
bytes, the file should be rejected as structurally unsound.  If a key
range generator is present and not the first generator, it should be
ignored.  If a velocity range generator is present, and is preceded by
a generator other than a key range generator, it should be ignored.
If a non-global list does not end in a sampleID generator, the split
should be ignored.  If the sampleID generator value is equal to or
greater than the terminal sampleID, the file should be rejected as
structurally unsound.


7.10  The SHDR Subchunk

The SHDR chunk is a required subchunk listing all samples within the
smpl subchunk and any referenced ROM samples.  It is always a multiple
of forty six bytes in length, and contains one record for each sample
plus a terminal record according to the structure:

struct sfSample
{
     CHAR achSampleName[20];
     DWORD dwStart;
     DWORD dwEnd;
     DWORD dwStartloop;
     DWORD dwEndloop;
     DWORD dwSampleRate;
     BYTE byOriginalPitch;
     CHAR chPitchCorrection;
     WORD wSampleLink;
     SFSampleLink sfSampleType;
};

The ASCII character field achSampleName contains the name of the
sample expressed in ASCII, with unused terminal characters filled with
zero valued bytes.  Sample names are case-sensitive.  A unique name
should always be assigned to each sample in the SoundFont compatible
bank to enable identification.  However, if a bank is read containing
the erroneous state of samples with identical names, the samples
should not be discarded.  They should either be preserved as read or
preferentially uniquely renamed.

The DWORD dwStart contains the index, in sample data points, from the
beginning of the sample data field to the first data point of this
sample.

The DWORD dwEnd contains the index, in sample data points, from the
beginning of the sample data field to the first of the set of 46 zero
valued data points following this sample.

The DWORD dwStartloop contains the index, in sample data points, from
the beginning of the sample data field to the first datapoint in the
loop of this sample.

The DWORD dwEndloop contains the index, in sample data points, from
the beginning of the sample data field to the first datapoint
following the loop of this sample.  Note that this is the data point
Oequivalent toO the first loop datapoint, and that to produce portable
artifact free loops, the eight proximal datapoints surrounding both
the Startloop and Endloop points should be identical.

The values of dwStart, dwEnd, dwStartloop, and dwEndloop must all be
within the range of the sample data field included in the SoundFont
compatible bank or referenced in the sound ROM.  Also, to allow a
variety of hardware platforms to be able to reproduce the data, the
samples have a minimum length of 48 data points, a minimum loop size
of 32 data points, and a minimum of 8 valid points prior to
dwStartloop and after dwEndloop.  Thus dwStart must be less than
dwStartloop-7, dwStartloop must be less than dwEndloop-31, and
dwEndloop must be less than dwEnd-7.  If these constraints are not
met, the sound may optionally not be played if the hardware cannot
support artifact-free playback for the parameters given.

The DWORD dwSampleRate contains the sample rate, in Hertz, at which
this sample was acquired or to which it was most recently converted.
Values of greater than 50000 or less than 400 may not be reproducable
by some hardware platforms and should be avoided.  A value of zero is
illegal.  If an illegal or impractical value is encountered, the
nearest practical value should be used.

The BYTE byOriginalPitch contains the MIDI key number of the recorded
pitch of the sample.  For example, a recording of an instrument
playing middle C (261.62 Hz) should receive a value of 60.  This value
is used as the default Oroot keyO for the sample, so that in the
example, a MIDI key-on command for note number 60 would reproduce the
sound at its original pitch.  For unpitched sounds, a conventional
value of 255 should be used.  Values between 128 and 254 are illegal.
Whenever an illegal value or a value of 255 is encountered, the value
60 should be used.

The CHAR chPitchCorrection contains a pitch correction in cents which
should be applied to the sample on playback.  The purpose of this
field is to compensate for any pitch errors during the sample
recording process.  The correction value is that of the correction to
be applied.  For example, if the sound is 4 cents sharp, a correction
bringing it 4 cents flat is required, thus the value should be -4.

The value in sfSampleType is an enumeration with eight defined values:
monoSample = 1, rightSample = 2, leftSample = 4, linkedSample = 8,
RomMonoSample = 32769, RomRightSample = 32770, RomLeftSample = 32772,
and RomLinkedSample = 32776.  It can be seen that this is encoded such
that bit 15 of the 16 bit value is set if the sample is in ROM, and
reset if it is included in the SoundFont compatible bank.  The four LS
bits of the word are then exclusively set indicating mono, left,
right, or linked.

If the sound is flagged as a ROM sample and no valid OiromO subchunk
is included, the file is structurally defective and should be rejected
at load time.

If sfSampleType indicates a mono sample, then wSampleLink is undefined
and its value should be conventionally zero, but will be ignored
regardless of value.  If sfSampleType indicates a left or right
sample, then wSampleLink is the sample header index of the associated
right or left stereo sample respectively.  Both samples should be
played entirely syncrhonously, with their pitch controlled by the
right sampleOs generators.  All non-pitch generators should apply as
normal; in particular the panning of the individual samples to left
and right should be accomplished via the pan generator.  Left-right
pairs should always be found within the same instrument.  Note also
that no instrument should be designed in which it is possible to
activate more than one instance of a particular stereo pair.  The
linked sample type is not currently fully defined in the SoundFont 2
specification, but will ultimately support a circularly linked list of
samples using wSampleLink.

The terminal sample record is never referenced, and is conventionally
entirely zero with the exception of achSampleName, which should be
OEOSO indicating end of samples.  All samples present in the smpl
subchunk are typically referenced by an instrument, however a file
containing any OorphanedO samples need not be rejected.  SoundFont
compatible applications can optionally ignore or filter out these
orphaned samples according to user preference.

If the SHDR subchunk is missing, or its is size is not a multiple of
46 bytes the file should be rejected as structurally unsound.


                            8  Enumerators

8.1  Generator Enumerators

8.1.1  Kinds of Generator Enumerators

Five kinds of Generator Enumerators exist:  Index Generators, Range
Generators, Substitution Generators, Sample Generators, and Value
Generators.

An Index Generator's amount is an index into another data structure.
The only two Index Generators are Instrument and sampleID.

A Range Generator defines a range of note-on parameters outside of
which the layer or split is undefined.  Two Range Generators are
currently defined, keyRange and velRange.

Substitution Generators are generators which substitute a value for a
note-on parameter.  Two Substitution Generators are currently defined,
overridingKeyNumber and overridingVelocity.

Sample Generators are generators which directly affect a sample's
properties.  These generators are undefined at the layer level.  The
currently defined Sample Generators are the eight address offset
generators, the sampleModes generator, the Overriding Root Key
generator and the Exclusive Class generator.

Value Generators are generators whose value directly affects a signal
processing parameter.  Most generators are value generators.


8.1.2  Generator Enumerators Defined

The following is an exhaustive list of SoundFont 2.00 generators and
their strict definitions:

0                    startAddrsOffset    The offset, in sample data
                     points, beyond the Start sample header parameter
                     to the first sample data point to be played for
                     this instrument.  For example, if Start were 7
                     and startAddrOffset were 2, the first sample
                     data point played would be sample data point 9.

1                    endAddrsOffset The offset, in sample sample data
                     points, beyond the End sample header parameter
                     to the last sample data point to be played for
                     this instrument.  For example, if End were 17
                     and endAddrOffset were -2, the last sample data
                     point played would be sample data point 15.

2                    startloopAddrsOffset     The offset, in sample
                     data points, beyond the Startloop sample header
                     parameter to the first sample data point to be
                     repeated in the loop for this instrument.  For
                     example, if Startloop were 10 and
                     startloopAddrOffset were -1, the first repeated
                     loop sample data point would be sample data
                     point 9.

3                    endloopAddrsOffset  The offset, in sample data
                     points, beyond the Endloop sample header
                     parameter to the sample data point considered
                     equivalent to the Startloop sample data point
                     for the loop for this instrument.  For example,
                     if Endloop were 15 and endloopAddrOffset were 2,
                     sample data point 17 would be considered
                     equivalent to the Startloop sample data point,
                     and hence sample data point 16 would effectively
                     precede Startloop during looping.

4                    startAddrsCoarseOffset   The offset, in 32768
                     sample data point increments beyond the Start
                     sample header parameter and the first sample
                     data point to be played in this instrument.
                     This parameter is added to the startAddrsOffset
                     parameter.  For example, if Start were 5,
                     startAddrOffset were 3 and startAddrCoarseOffset
                     were 2, the first sample data point played would
                     be sample data point 65544.

5                    modLfoToPitch  This is the degree, in cents, to
                     which a full scale excursion of the Modulation
                     LFO will influence pitch.  A positive value
                     indicates a positive LFO excursion increases
                     pitch; a negative value indicates a positive
                     excursion decreases pitch.  Pitch is always
                     modified logarithmically, that is the deviation
                     is in cents, semitones, and octaves rather than
                     in Hz.  For example, a value of 100 indicates
                     that the pitch will first rise 1 semitone, then
                     fall one semitone.

6                    vibLfoToPitch  This is the degree, in cents, to
                     which a full scale excursion of the Vibrato LFO
                     will influence pitch.  A positive value
                     indicates a positive LFO excursion increases
                     pitch; a negative value indicates a positive
                     excursion decreases pitch.  Pitch is always
                     modified logarithmically, that is the deviation
                     is in cents, semitones, and octaves rather than
                     in Hz.  For example, a value of 100 indicates
                     that the pitch will first rise 1 semitone, then
                     fall one semitone.

7                    modEnvToPitch  This is the degree, in cents, to
                     which a full scale excursion of the Modulation
                     Envelope will influence pitch.  A positive value
                     indicates an increase in pitch; a negative value
                     indicates a decrease in pitch.  Pitch is always
                     modified logarithmically, that is the deviation
                     is in cents, semitones, and octaves rather than
                     in Hz.  For example, a value of 100 indicates
                     that the pitch will rise 1 semitone at the
                     envelope peak.

8                    initialFilterFc     This is the cutoff and
                     resonant frequency of the lowpass filter in
                     absolute cent units.  The lowpass filter is
                     defined as a second order resonant pole pair
                     whose pole frequency in Hz is defined by the
                     Initial Filter Cutoff parameter.  When the
                     cutoff frequency exceeds 20kHz and the Q
                     (resonance) of the filter is zero, the filter
                     does not affect the signal.

9                    initialFilterQ This is the height above DC gain
                     in centibels which the filter resonance exhibits
                     at the cutoff frequency.  A value of zero or
                     less indicates the filter is not resonant; the
                     gain at the cutoff frequency (pole angle) may be
                     less than zero when zero is specified.  The
                     filter gain at DC is also affected by this
                     parameter such that the gain at DC is reduced by
                     half the specified gain.  For example, for a
                     value of 100, the filter gain at DC would be 5
                     dB below unity gain, and the height of the
                     resonant peak would be 10 dB above the DC gain,
                     or 5 dB above unity gain.  Note also that if
                     initialFilterQ is set to zero or less and the
                     cutoff frequency exceeds 20 kHz, then the filter
                     response is flat and unity gain.

10                   modLfoToFilterFc    This is the degree, in
                     cents, to which a full scale excursion of the
                     Modulation LFO will influence filter cutoff
                     frequency.  A positive number indicates a
                     positive LFO excursion increases cutoff
                     frequency; a negative number indicates a
                     positive excursion decreases cutoff frequency.
                     Filter cutoff frequency is always modified
                     logarithmically, that is the deviation is in
                     cents, semitones, and octaves rather than in Hz.
                     For example, a value of 1200 indicates that the
                     cutoff frequency will first rise 1 octave, then
                     fall one octave.

11                   modEnvToFilterFc    This is the degree, in
                     cents, to which a full scale excursion of the
                     Modulation Envelope will influence filter
                     cutoff.  A positive number indicates an increase
                     in cutoff frequency; a negative number indicates
                     a decrease in filter cutoff.  Filter cutoff is
                     always modified logarithmically, that is the
                     deviation is in cents, semitones, and octaves
                     rather than in Hz.  For example, a value of 1000
                     indicates that the cutoff frequency will rise
                     one octave at the envelope attack peak.

12                   endAddrsCoarseOffset     The offset, in 32768
                     sample data point increments beyond the End
                     sample header parameter and the last sample data
                     point to be played in this instrument.  This
                     parameter is added to the endAddrsOffset
                     parameter.  For example, if End were 65536,
                     startAddrOffset were -3 and
                     startAddrCoarseOffset were -1, the last sample
                     data point played would be sample data point
                     32765.

13                   modLfoToVolume This is the degree, in centibels,
                     to which a full scale excursion of the
                     Modulation LFO will influence volume.  A
                     positive number indicates a positive LFO
                     excursion increases volume; a negative number
                     indicates a positive excursion decreases volume.
                     Volume is always modified logarithmically, that
                     is the deviation is in decibels rather than in
                     linear amplitude.  For example, a value of 100
                     indicates that the volume will first rise ten
                     dB, then fall ten dB.

15                   chorusEffectsSend   This is the degree, in 0.1%
                     units, to which the audio output of the note is
                     sent to the chorus effects processor.  A value
                     of 0% or less indicates no signal is sent from
                     this note; a value of 100% or more indicates the
                     note is sent at full level.  Note that this
                     parameter has no effect on the amount of this
                     signal sent to the OdryO or unprocessed portion
                     of the output.  For example, a value of 250
                     indicates that the signal is sent at 25% of full
                     level (attenuation of 12 dB from full level) to
                     the chorus effects processor.

17                   pan  This is the degree, in 0.1% units, to which
                     the OdryO audio output of the note is positioned
                     to the left or right output.  A value of -50% or
                     less indicates the signal is sent entirely to
                     the left output and not sent to the right
                     output; a value of +50% or more indicates the
                     note is sent entirely to the right and not sent
                     to the left.  A value of zero places the signal
                     centered between left and right.  For example, a
                     value of -250 indicates that the signal is sent
                     at 75% of full level to the left output and 25%
                     of full level to the right output.

21                   delayModLFO    This is the delay time, in
                     absolute timecents, from key on until the
                     Modulation LFO begins its upward ramp from zero
                     value.  A value of 0 indicates a 1 second delay.
                     A negative value indicates a delay less than one
                     second and a positive value a delay longer than
                     one second.  The most negative number (-32768)
                     conventionally indicates no delay.  For example,
                     a delay of 10 msec would be 1200log2(.01) = -
                     7973.

22                   freqModLFO     This is the frequency, in
                     absolute cents, of the Modulation LFOOs
                     triangular period.  A value of zero indicates a
                     frequency of 8.176 Hz.  A negative value
                     indicates a frequency less than 8.176 Hz; a
                     positive value a frequency greater than 8.176
                     Hz.  For example, a frequency of 10 mHz would be
                     1200log2(.01/8.176) = -11610.

23                   delayVibLFO    This is the delay time, in

                     Vibrato LFO begins its upward ramp from zero
                     value.  A value of 0 indicates a 1 second delay.
                     A negative value indicates a delay less than one
                     second; a positive value a delay longer than one
                     second.  The most negative number (-32768)
                     conventionally indicates no delay.  For example,

24                   freqVibLFO     This is the frequency, in

                     period.  A value of zero indicates a frequency
                     of 8.176 Hz.  A negative value indicates a
                     frequency less than 8.176 Hz; a positive value a
                     frequency greater than 8.176 Hz.  For example, a
                     frequency of 10 mHz would be 1200log2(.01/8.176)
                     = -11610.

25                   delayModEnv    This is the delay time, in
                     absolute timecents, between key on and the start
                     of the attack phase of the Modulation envelope.
                     A value of 0 indicates a 1 second delay.  A
                     negative value indicates a delay less than one
                     second; a positive value a delay longer than one
                     second.  The most negative number (-32768)
                     conventionally indicates no delay.  For example,
                     a delay of 10 msec would be 1200log2(.01) = -
                     7973.

26                   attackModEnv   This is the time, in absolute
                     timecents, from the end of the Modulation
                     Envelope Delay Time until the point at which the
                     Modulation Envelope value reaches its peak.
                     Note that the attack is OconvexO; the curve is
                     nominally such that when applied to a decibel or
                     semitone parameter, the result is linear in
                     amplitude or Hz respectively.  A value of 0
                     indicates a 1 second attack time.  A negative
                     value indicates a time less than one second; a
                     positive value a time longer than one second.
                     The most negative number (-32768) conventionally
                     indicates instantaneous attack.  For example, an
                     attack time of 10 msec would be 1200log2(.01) =
                     -7973.

27                   holdModEnv     This is the time, in absolute
                     timecents, from the end of the attack phase to
                     the entry into decay phase, during which the
                     envelope value is held at its peak.  A value of
                     0 indicates a 1 second hold time.  A negative
                     value indicates a time less than one second; a
                     positive value a time longer than one second.
                     The most negative number (-32768) conventionally
                     indicates no hold phase.  For example, a hold
                     time of 10 msec would be 1200log2(.01) = -7973.

28                   decayModEnv    This is the time, in absolute
                     timecents, for a 100% change in the Modulation
                     Envelope value during decay phase.  For the
                     Modulation Envelope, the decay phase linearly
                     ramps toward the sustain level.  If the sustain
                     level were zero, the Modulation Envelope Decay
                     Time would be the time spent in decay phase.  A
                     value of 0 indicates a 1 second decay time for a
                     zero sustain level.  A negative value indicates
                     a time less than one second;  a positive value a
                     time longer than one second.  For example, a
                     decay time of 10 msec would be 1200log2(.01) = -
                     7973.

29                   sustainModEnv  This is the decrease in level,
                     expressed in 0.1% units, over which the
                     Modulation Envelope value ramps during the decay
                     phase.  For the Modulation Envelope, the sustain
                     level is properly expressed in percent of full
                     scale.  Because the volume envelope sustain
                     level is expressed as an attenuation from full
                     scale, the sustain level is analogously
                     expressed as a decrease from full scale.  A
                     value of 0 indicates the sustain level is full
                     level; this implies a zero duration of decay
                     phase regardless of decay time.  A positive
                     value indicates a decay to the corresponding
                     level.  Values less than zero are to be
                     interpreted as zero; values above 1000 are to be
                     interpreted as 1000.  For example, a sustain
                     level which corresponds to an absolute value 40%
                     of peak would be 600.

30                   releaseModEnv  This is the time, in absolute
                     timecents, for a 100% change in the Modulation
                     Envelope value during release phase.  For the
                     Modulation Envelope, the release phase linearly
                     ramps toward zero from the current level.  If
                     the current level were full scale, the
                     Modulation Envelope Release Time would be the
                     time spent in release phase until zero value
                     were reached.  A value of 0 indicates a 1 second
                     decay time for a release from full level.  A
                     negative value indicates a time less than one
                     second; a positive value a time longer than one
                     second.  For example, a release time of 10 msec
                     would be 1200log2(.01) = -7973.

31                   keynumToModEnvHold  This is the degree, in
                     timecent per keynumber units, to which the hold
                     time of the Modulation Envelope is decreased by
                     increasing MIDI key number.  The hold time at
                     key number 60 is always unchanged.  The unit
                     scaling is such that a value of 100 provides a
                     hold time which tracks the keyboard; that is, an
                     upward octave causes the hold time to halve.
                     For example, if the Modulation Envelope Hold
                     Time were -7973 = 10 msec and the Key Number to
                     Mod Env Hold were 50 when key number 36 was
                     played, the hold time would be 20 msec.

32                   keynumToModEnvDecay This is the degree, in
                     timecent per keynumber units, to which the hold
                     time of the Modulation Envelope is decreased by
                     increasing MIDI key number.  The hold time at
                     key number 60 is always unchanged.  The unit
                     scaling is such that a value of 100 provides a
                     hold time which tracks the keyboard; that is, an
                     upward octave causes the hold time to halve.
                     For example, if the Modulation Envelope Hold
                     Time were -7973 = 10 msec and the Key Number to
                     Mod Env Hold were 50 when key number 36 was
                     played, the hold time would be 20 msec.

33                   delayVolEnv    This is the delay time, in
                     absolute timecents, between key on and the start
                     of the attack phase of the Volume envelope.  A
                     value of 0 indicates a 1 second delay.  A
                     negative value indicates a delay less than one
                     second; a positive value a delay longer than one
                     second.  The most negative number (-32768)
                     conventionally indicates no delay.  For example,
                     a delay of 10 msec would be 1200log2(.01) = -
                     7973.

34                   attackVolEnv   This is the time, in absolute
                     timecents, from the end of the Volume Envelope
                     Delay Time until the point at which the Volume
                     Envelope value reaches its peak.  Note that the
                     attack is OconvexO; the curve is nominally such
                     that when applied to the decibel volume
                     parameter, the result is linear in amplitude.  A
                     value of 0 indicates a 1 second attack time.  A
                     negative value indicates a time less than one
                     second; a positive value a time longer than one
                     second.  The most negative number (-32768)
                     conventionally indicates instantaneous attack.
                     For example, an attack time of 10 msec would be
                     1200log2(.01) = -7973.

35                   holdVolEnv     This is the time, in absolute
                     timecents, from the end of the attack phase to
                     the entry into decay phase, during which the
                     Volume envelope value is held at its peak.  A
                     value of 0 indicates a 1 second hold time.  A
                     negative value indicates a time less than one
                     second; a positive value a time longer than one
                     second.  The most negative number (-32768)
                     conventionally indicates no hold phase.  For
                     example, a hold time of 10 msec would be
                     1200log2(.01) = -7973.

36                   decayVolEnv    This is the time, in absolute
                     timecents, for a 100% change in the Volume
                     Envelope value during decay phase.  For the
                     Volume Envelope, the decay phase linearly ramps
                     toward the sustain level, causing a constant dB
                     change for each time unit.  If the sustain level
                     were -100dB, the Volume Envelope Decay Time
                     would be the time spent in decay phase.  A value
                     of 0 indicates a 1 second decay time for a zero
                     sustain level.  A negative value indicates a
                     time less than one second;  a positive value a
                     time longer than one second.  For example, a
                     decay time of 10 msec would be 1200log2(.01) = -
                     7973.

37                   sustainVolEnv  This is the decrease in level,
                     expressed in centibels, over which the Volume
                     Envelope value ramps during the decay phase.
                     For the Volume Envelope, the sustain level is
                     best expressed in cB of attenuation from full
                     scale.  A value of 0 indicates the sustain level
                     is full level; this implies a zero duration of
                     decay phase regardless of decay time.  A
                     positive value indicates a decay to the
                     corresponding level.  Values less than zero are
                     to be interpreted as zero; conventionally 1000
                     indicates full attenuation.  For example, a
                     sustain level which corresponds to an absolute
                     value 12dB below of peak would be 120.

38                   releaseVolEnv  This is the time, in absolute
                     timecents, for a 100% change in the Volume
                     Envelope value during release phase.  For the
                     Volume Envelope, the release phase linearly
                     ramps toward zero from the current level,
                     causing a constant dB change for each time unit.
                     If the current level were full scale, the Volume
                     Envelope Release Time would be the time spent in
                     release phase until -100dB attenuation were
                     reached.  A value of 0 indicates a 1 second
                     decay time for a release from full level.  A
                     negative value indicates a time less than one
                     second; a positive value a time longer than one
                     second.  For example, a release time of 10 msec
                     would be 1200log2(.01) = -7973.

39                   keynumToVolEnvHold  This is the degree, in
                     timecent per keynumber units, to which the hold
                     time of the Volume Envelope is decreased by
                     increasing MIDI key number.  The hold time at
                     key number 60 is always unchanged.  The unit
                     scaling is such that a value of 100 provides a
                     hold time which tracks the keyboard; that is, an
                     upward octave causes the hold time to halve.
                     For example, if the Volume Envelope Hold Time
                     were -7973 = 10 msec and the Key Number to Vol
                     Env Hold were 50 when key number 36 was played,
                     the hold time would be 20 msec.

40                   keynumToVolEnvDecay This is the degree, in
                     timecent per keynumber units, to which the hold
                     time of the Volume Envelope is decreased by
                     increasing MIDI key number.  The hold time at
                     key number 60 is always unchanged.  The unit
                     scaling is such that a value of 100 provides a
                     hold time which tracks the keyboard; that is, an
                     upward octave causes the hold time to halve.
                     For example, if the Volume Envelope Hold Time
                     were -7973 = 10 msec and the Key Number to Vol
                     Env Hold were 50 when key number 36 was played,
                     the hold time would be 20 msec.

41                   instrument     This is the index into the INST
                     subchunk providing the instrument to be used for
                     the current layer.  A value of zero indicates
                     the first instrument in the list.  The value
                     should never exceed two less than the size of
                     the instrument list.  The instrument enumerator
                     is the terminal generator for PGEN layers.  As
                     such, it should only appear in the PGEN
                     subchunk, and it must appear as the last
                     generator enumerator in all but the global
                     layer.

42                   reserved1 Unused, reserved.  Should be ignored
                     if encountered.

43                   keyRange  This is the minimum and maximum MIDI
                     key number values for which this preset, layer,
                     instrument or split is active. The LS byte
                     indicates the highest and the MS byte the lowest
                     valid key .  The keyRange enumerator is
                     optional, but when it does appear, it must be
                     the first generator in the preset layer or
                     instrument split generator list.

44                   velRange  This is the minimum and maximum MIDI
                     velocity values for which this preset, layer,
                     instrument or split is active. The LS byte
                     indicates the highest and the MS byte the lowest
                     valid velocity .  The velRange enumerator is
                     optional, but when it does appear, it must be
                     preceded only by keyRange in the preset layer or
                     instrument split generator list.

45                   startloopAddrsCoarseOffset    The offset, in
                     32768 sample data point increments beyond the
                     Startloop sample header parameter and the first
                     sample data point to be repeated in this
                     instrumentOs loop.  This parameter is added to
                     the startloopAddrsOffset parameter.  For
                     example, if Startloop were 5,
                     startloopAddrOffset were 3 and
                     startAddrCoarseOffset were 2, the first sample
                     data point in the loop would be sample data
                     point 65544.

46                   keynum    This enumerator forces the MIDI key
                     number to effectively be interpreted as the
                     value given.  This generator caon only appear at
                     the instrument level.  Valid values are from 0
                     to 127.

47                   velocity  This enumerator forces the MIDI
                     velocity to effectively be interpreted as the
                     value given. This generator caon only appear at
                     the instrument level.  Valid values are from 0
                     to 127.

48                   initialAttenuation  This is the attenuation, in
                     centibels, by which a note is attenuated below
                     full scale.  A value of zero indicates no
                     attenuation; the note will be played at full
                     scale.  For example, a value of 60 indicates the
                     note will be played at 6 dB below full scale for
                     the note.

50                   endloopAddrsCoarseOffset The offset, in 32768
                     sample data point increments beyond the Endloop
                     sample header parameter parameter to the sample
                     data point considered equivalent to the
                     Startloop sample data point for the loop for
                     this instrument.  This parameter is added to the
                     endloopAddrsOffset parameter.  For example, if
                     Endloop were 5, endloopAddrOffset were 3 and
                     endAddrCoarseOffset were 2, sample data point
                     65544 would be considered equivalent to the
                     Startloop sample data point, and hence sample
                     data point 65543 would effectively precede
                     Startloop during looping.

51                   coarseTune     This is a pitch offset, in
                     semitones, which should be applied to the note.
                     A positive value indicates the sound is
                     reproduced at a higher pitch; a negative value
                     indicates a lower pitch.  For example, a Coarse
                     Tune value of -4 would cause the sound to be
                     reproduced four semitones flat.

52                   fineTune  This is a pitch offset, in cents,
                     which should be applied to the note.  It is
                     additive with coarseTune.  A positive value
                     indicates the sound is reproduced at a higher
                     pitch; a negative value indicates a lower pitch.
                     .  For example, a Fine Tuning value of -5 would
                     cause the sound to be reproduced five cents
                     flat.

53                   sampleID  This is the index into the SHDR
                     subchunk providing the sample to be used for the
                     current split.  A value of zero indicates the
                     first sample in the list.  The value should
                     never exceed two less than the size of the
                     sample list.  The sampleID enumerator is the
                     terminal generator for IGEN splits.  As such, it
                     should only appear in the IGEN subchunk, and it
                     must appear as the last generator enumerator in
                     all but the global split.

54                   sampleModes    This enumerator indicates a value
                     which gives a variety of Boolean flags
                     describing the sample for the current instrument
                     split.  The sampleModes should only appear in
                     the IGEN subchunk, and should not appear in the
                     global split.  The two LS bits of the value
                     indicate the type of loop in the sample:  0
                     indicates a sound reproduced with no loop, 1
                     indicates a sound which loops continuously, 2 is
                     unused but should be interpreted as indicating
                     no loop, and 3 indicates a sound which loops for
                     the duration of key depression then proceeds to
                     play the remainder of the sample.

                     if encountered.

56                   scaleTuning    This parameter represents the
                     degree to which MIDI key number influences
                     pitch.  A value of zero indicates that MIDI key
                     number has no effect on pitch; a value of 100
                     represents the usual tempered semitone scale.

57                   exclusiveClass This parameter provides the
                     capability for a key depression in a given
                     instrument to terminate the playback of other
                     instruments.  This is particularly useful for
                     percussive instruments such as a hihat cymbal.
                     An exclusive class value of zero indicates no
                     exclusive class; no special action is taken.
                     Any other value indicates that when this note is
                     initiated, any other sounding note with the same
                     exclusive class value should be rapidly
                     terminated.  The exclusive class generator can
                     only appear at the instrument level.  The scope
                     of the exclusive class is the entire preset.  In
                     other words, any other instrument split within
                     the same preset holding a corresponding
                     exclusive class will be terminated.

58                   overridingRootKey   This parameter represents
                     the MIDI key number at which the sample is to be
                     played back at its original sample rate.  If not
                     present, or if present with a value of -1, then
                     the sample header parameter Original Key is used
                     in its place.  If it is present in the range 0-
                     127, then the indicated key number will cause
                     the sample to be played back at its sample
                     header Sample Rate.  For example, if the sample
                     were a recording of a piano middle C (Original
                     Key = 60) at a sample rate of 22.050 kHz, and
                     Root Key were set to 69, then playing MIDI key
                     number 69 (A above middle C) would cause a piano
                     note of pitch middle C to be heard.

8.2  Source Enumerators

In SoundFont 2.00, no modulators have yet been defined, hence no
Source Enumerators have yet been established.  Future Source
Enumerators will include MIDI key number, MIDI key velocity, MIDI
pitch bend, MIDI channel pressure, and various MIDI continuous
controllers.


8.3  Transform Enumerators

In SoundFont 2.00, no modulators have yet been defined, hence no
Transform Enumerators have yet been established.  Future Transform
Enumerators will include a linear, or OnullO transform, as enumerator
0, and other transforms as required to implement the current default
modulators.


8.4  Default Modulators

In SoundFont 2.00, although no modulators have yet been defined,
certain default modulation paths are expected to be implemented as
standard.  In a future revision to SoundFont 2, these default
modulators will be implemented within the modulator structure,
allowing variations from the defaults.  The current default modulators
are described below:


8.4.1  MIDI Key Velocity to Initial Attenuation

The MIDI key number is passed through a OMIDI velocity to dBO
transform to change it to the standard dB volume attentuation curve
for MIDI velocity.  A mathematical model for this transform will be
included in a future version of this specification.  The transformed
result is then added to the initial attenuation generator.


8.4.2  MIDI Key Velocity to Filter Cutoff

The MIDI key number is passed through a OMIDI velocity to FcO
transform. A mathematical model for this transform will be included in
a future version of this specification.  The resulting value is added
to the initial filter cutoff.  This default modulator does not occur
unless the volume envelope attack time is less than 7 msec.


8.4.3  MIDI Channel Pressure to Vibrato LFO to Pitch

The MIDI Channel Pressure value value is divided by 128 to give a
scaled value from zero to 127/128.  This value is then multiplied by
18 and added to the Vibrato to LFO Pitch generator to give an increase
in vibrato depth of 18 cents full scale.


8.4.4  MIDI Continuous Controller 1 to Vibrato LFO to Pitch

The MIDI Continuous Controller 1 value is divided by 128 to give a
scaled value from zero to 127/128.  This value is then multiplied by
18 and added to the Vibrato to LFO Pitch generator to give an increase
in vibrato depth of 18 cents full scale.


8.4.5  MIDI Continuous Controller 7 to Initial Attenuation

The MIDI Continuous Controller 7 value is passed through a OMIDI
velocity to dBO transform to change it to the standard dB volume
attentuation curve for MIDI velocity. A mathematical model for this
transform will be included in a future version of this specification.
The transformed result is then added to the initial attenuation
generator.


8.4.6  MIDI Continuous Controller 10 to Pan Position

The MIDI Continuous Controller 10 value is added to -64, and the
result divided by 64 to produce a scaled value ranging from -1 to
+63/64.  This value is then multiplied by 1000 and added to the pan
generator to give a change in pan position from -100% to +100%.


8.4.7  MIDI Continuous Controller 11 to Initial Attentuation

The MIDI Continuous Controller 11 value is passed through a OMIDI
expressionO transform to change it to the standard dB volume
attentuation curve for MIDI CC11. A mathematical model for this
transform will be included in a future version of this specification.
The transfromed result is then added to the initial attenuation
generator.


8.4.8  MIDI Continuous Controller 91 to Reverb Effects Send

The MIDI Continuous Controller 91 value is divided by 128 to give a
scaled value from zero to 127/128.  This value is then multiplied by
1000 and added to the reverbEffectsSend generator to give a change in
reverb send from zero to +100%.


8.4.9  MIDI Continuous Controller 93 to Chorus Effects Send

The MIDI Continuous Controller 93 value is divided by 128 to give a
scaled value from zero to 127/128.  This value is then multiplied by
1000 and added to the chorusEffectsSend generator to give a change in
chrous send from zero to +100%.


8.5  Precedence and Absolute and Relative values.

Most SoundFont generators are available at both the Instrument and
Preset Levels, as well as having a default value.  Generators at the
Instrument Level are considered OabsoluteO and determine an actual
physical value for the associated synthesis parameter, which is used
instead of the default.  For example, an value of 1200 for the
attackVolEnv generator would produce an absolute time of 1200
timecents or 2 seconds of attack time for the volume envelope, instead
of the default value of -12000 timecents or 1 msec.

Generators at the Preset Level are instead considered OrelativeO and
additive to all the default or instrument level generators within the
Preset Layer.  For example, a value of 2400 timecents for the
attackVolEnv generator in a preset layer containing an instrument with
two splits, one with the default attackVelEnv and one with an absolute
attackVolEnv generator value of 1200 timecents would cause the default
split to actually have a value of -9600 timecents or 4 msec, and the
other to have a value of 3600 timecents or 8 seconds attack time.

There are some generators which are not available at the Preset Level.
These are:

#    Name
0    startAddrsOffset
1    endAddrsOffset
2    startloopAddrsOffset
3    endloopAddrsOffset
4    startAddrsCoarseOffset
12   endAddrsCoarseOffset
45   startloopAddrsCoarseOffset
46   keynum
47   velocity
50   endloopAddrsCoarseOffset
54   sampleModes
57   exclusiveClass
58   overridingRootKey

If these generators are encountered in the Preset Level, they should
be ignored.


                   9  Parameters and Synthesis Model

The SoundFont 2 standard has been established with the intent of
providing support for an expanding base of wavetable based synthesis
models.  The model supported by the SoundFont 2 specification
originates with the EMU8000 wavetable synthesizer chip.  The
description below of the underlying synthesis model and the associated
parameters are provided to allow mapping of this synthesis model onto
other hardware platforms.


9.1  Synthesis Model

The SoundFont 2 specification Synthesis Model comprises a wavetable
oscillator, a dynamic lowpass filter, an enveloping amplifier, and
programmable sends to pan, reverb, and chorus effects units.  An
underlying modulation engine comprises two low frequency oscillators
(LFOs) and two envelope generators with appropriate routing
amplifiers.


9.1.1  Wavetable Oscillator

The SoundFont 2 specificationWavetable oscillator model is capable of
playing back a sample at an arbitrary sampling rate with an arbitrary
pitch shift.  In practice, the upward pitch shift (downward sample
rate conversion) will be limited to a maximum value, typically at
least two octaves.  The pitch is described in terms of an initial
pitch shift which is based on the sampleOs sampling rate, the root key
at which the sample should be unshifted on the keyboard, the coarse,
fine, and correction tunings, the effective MIDI key number, and the
keyboard scale factor.  All modulations in pitch are in octaves,
semitones, and cents.


9.1.2  Sample Looping

The wavetable oscillator is playing a digital sample which is
described in terms of a start point, end point, and two points
describing a loop.  The sound can be flagged as unlooped, in which
case the loop points are ignored.  If the sound is looped, in can be
played in two ways.  If it is flagged as Oloop during releaseO, the
sound is played from the start point through the loop, and loops until
the note becomes inaudible.  If not, the sound is played from the
start point through the loop, and loops until the key is released.  At
this point, the next time the loop end point is reached, the sound
continues through the loop end point and plays until the end point is
reached, at which time audio is terminated.


9.1.3  Lowpass Filter

The synthesis model contains a resonant lowpass filter, which is
characterized by a dynamic cutoff frequency and a fixed resonance (Q).
Because there is tremendous variation within the industry as to filter
implementations, this filter is idealized rather than being specified
as a particular realization.

The filter is idealized at zero resonance as having a flat passband to
the cutoff frequency, then a rolloff at 6dB per octave above that
frequency.  The resonance, when non-zero, comprises a peak at the
cutoff frequency, superimposed on the above response.  The resonance
is measured as a dB ratio of the resonant peak to the DC gain.  The DC
gain at any resonance is half of the resonance value below the DC gain
at zero resonance; hence the peak height is half the resonance value
above DC gain at zero resonance.

All modulations in cutoff frequency are in octaves, semitones, and
cents.

                                   
                   Figure 1 - Ideal Filter Response


9.1.4  Final Gain Amplifier

The final gain amplifier is a multiplier on the filter output, which
is controlled by an initial gain in dB.  This is added to the volume
envelope.  Additional modulation can also be added.  The gain is
always specified in dB.


9.1.5  Effects Sends

The output of the final gain amplifier can be routed into the effects
unit.  This unit causes the sound to be located (panned) in the stereo
field, and a degree of reverberation and chorus to be added.  The pan
is specified in terms of percentage left and right, which also could
be considered as an azimuth angle.  The reverb and chorus sends are
specified as a percentage of the signal amplitude to be sent to these
units, from 0% to 100%.


9.1.6  Low Frequency Oscillators

The synthesis model provides for two low frequency oscillators (LFOs)
for modulating pitch, filter cutoff, and amplitude.  The OvibratoO LFO
is only capable of modulating pitch.  The OmodulationO LFO can
modulate any of the three parameters.

An  LFO is defined as having a delay period during which its value
remains zero, followed by a triangular waveshape ramping linearly to
positive one, then downward to negative 1, then upward again to
positive one, etc.

Each parameter can be modulated to a varying degree, either positively
or negatively, by the associated LFO.  Modulations of pitch and cutoff
are in octaves, semitones, and cents, while modulations of amplitude
are in dB.  The degree of modulation is specified in cents or dB for
the full scale positive LFO excursion.


9.1.7  Envelope Generators

The synthesis model provides for two envelope generators.  The volume
envelope generator controls the final gain amplifier and hence
determines the volume contour of the sound.  The modulation envelope
can control pitch and/or filter cutoff.

An envelope generates a control signal in six phases.  When key-on
occurs, a delay period begins during which the envelope value is zero.
The envelope then rises in a convex curve to a value of one during the
attack phase.  When a value of one is reached, the envelope enters a
hold phase during which it remains at one.  When the hold phase ends,
the envelope enters a decay phase during which its value decreases
linearly to a sustain level.  When the sustain level is reached, the
envelope enters sustain phase, during which the envelope stays at the
sustain level.  Whenever a key-off occurs, the envelope immediately
enters a release phase during which the value linearly ramps from the
current value to zero.  When zero is reached, the envelope value
remains at zero.

Modulation of pitch and filter cutoff are in octaves, semitones, and
cents.  These parameters can be mdoulated to varying degree, either
positively or negatively, by the modulation envelope.  The degree of
modulation is specified in cents for the full scale attack peak.

The volume envelope operates in dB, with the attack peak providing a
full scale output, appropriately scaled by the initial volume.  The
zero value, however, is actually zero gain.  The implementation in the
EMU8000 provides for 96 dB of amplitude control.  When 96 dB of
attenuation is reached in the final gain amplifier, an abrupt jump to
zero gain (infinite dB of attenuation) occurs.  In a 16 bit system,
this jump is inaudible.


9.1.8  Modulation Interconnection Summary

The following diagram shows the interconnections expressed in the
SoundFont 2 specification synthesis model:

9.2  MIDI Functions

The response to certain MIDI commands is defined within the MIDI spec,
and is not considered to be part of the SoundFont 2 specification.
For completeness, the expected response is given here.

MIDI key number to Pitch - Relative to the Root Key as determined by
the sample header byOriginalPitch and the Instrument Split
overridingRootKey, keynumber varies the pitch by one cent times the
scaleTune generator per keynumber.

MIDI Pitch Bend - Changes the pitch of all notes in the MIDI channel
as specified by the sensitivity set by the MIDI synthesizer mode or by
using MIDI Registered Parameters.

MIDI CC64 Sustain - ACTIVE when greater than or equal to 64.  When the
sustain function is active, all notes in the key-on state remain in
the key-on state regardless of whether a key-off command for the note
arrives.  The key-off commands are stored, and when sustain becomes
inactive, all stored key-off commands are executed.

MIDI CC66 Soft - ACTIVE when greater than or equal to 64.  When
active, all new key-ons are modulated in such a way to make the note
sound Osoft.O  This typically affects initial attentuation and filter
cutoff is a pre-defined manner.

MIDI CC67 Sostenuto - ACTIVE when greater than or equal to 64.  When
sostenuto becomes active, all notes currently in the key-on state
remain in the key-on state until the sostenuto becomes inactive.  All
other notes behave normally.  Notes maintained by sostenuto in key-on
state remain in key-on state even if sustain is switched on and off.


9.3  Parameter Units

The units with which SoundFont generators are described are all well
defined.  The strict definitions appear below:

ABSOLUTE SAMPLE DATA POINTS - A numeric index of 16 bit sample data
point words as stored in ROM or supplied in the smpl-ck, indexing the
first sample data point word of memory or the chunk as zero.

RELATIVE SAMPLE DATA POINTS - A count of 16 bit sample data point
words based on an absolute sample data point reference.  A negative
value implies a relative count toward the beginning of the data.

ABSOLUTE SEMITONES - A absolute logarithmic measure of frequency based
on a reference of MIDI key numbers.  A semitone is 1/12 of an octave,

so a value of zero is 0% and a value of 1000 is 100%.

RELATIVE PERCENT - A relative measure of gain difference.  In
SoundFont 2, relative percent is measured in 0.1% units.  When the
gain goes below zero, zero is assumed; when the gain exceeds 100%,
100% is used.


9.4  On Implementation Accuracy

While the SoundFont 2 standard is well defined, it must be recognized
that there are a large variety of practices and features within the
wavetable music synthesis industry that are not conducive to exact
implementation of the specification as defined.  Some examples of
impediments include the order of interpolation of sample data points,
the exact shape and number of segments of envelopes, the filter
implementation, and the details of the implementation of loops.

Additionally, all real implementations are likely to have less
accuracy than the SoundFont 2 standard itself.  The units for the
standard have been chosen to exceed the accuracy required for high
fidelity applications.  It should be recognized that in rendering a
SoundFont 2 compatible file, a best practical reproduction is all that
is expected.

As such, implementers of SoundFont 2 compatible rendering engines will
have to determine based on their own perceptual criteria the degree to
which their implementation meets the standard.  Approximations may
take a variety of forms.  In many cases, the resolution of the
rendering engine will be less than that of the corresponding SoundFont
unit.  Also, it will frequently be the case that a line segment
approximation will be made to a continuous curve.  In the case of
filters, the order of the filter may vary from the SoundFont 2
standard, and an optimum audible equivalent will have to be
heuristically constructed.  All such problems are left to the
ingenuity of the implementers.


                          10  Error Handling

10.1  Structural Errors

Structural Errors are errors which are determined from the implicit
redundancy of the SoundFont RIFF file structure, and indicate that the
structure is not intact.  Examples are incorrect lengths for the
chunks or subchunks, pointers out of valid range, or missing required
chunks or subchunks for which no error correction procedure exists.

In all cases, files should be checked for structural errors at load
time, and if any are found the files should be rejected.  Separate
tools or options can be used to OrepairO structurally  defective
files, but these tools should validate that the reconstructed file is
not only a valid SoundFont compatible bank but also complies with the
intended timbral results in all cases.


10.2  Unknown Chunks

In parsing the RIFF structure, unknown but well formed chunks or
subchunks may be encountered.  Unknown chunks within the INFO-list
chunk should simply be ignored.  Other unknown chunks or subchunks are
illegal and should be treated as structural errors.


10.3  Unknown Enumerators

Unknown enumerators may be encountered in Generators, Modulator
Sources, or Transforms.  This is to be expected if the ifil field
exceeds the specification to which the application was written.  Even
if unexpected, unknown enumerators should simply cause the associated
Generator or Modulator to be ignored.


10.4  Illegal Parameter Values

Some SoundFont parameters are defined for only a limited range of the
possible values which can be expressed in their field.  If the value
of the field is not in the defined range, the parameter has an illegal
value.

Illegal values for may be detected either at load or at run time.  If
detected at load time, the file may optionally be rejected as
structurally unsound.  If detected at run time, the default value for
the parameter should be used if the parameter is required, or the
entire Generator or Modulator ignored if it is optional.  Certain
parameters may have more specific procedures for illegal values as
expressed elsewhere in this specification.


10.5  Out-of-range Values

SoundFont parameters have a specified minimum and useful range the
span the perceptually relevant values for the associated sonic
property.  When the parameter value is exceeds this useful range, the
parameter is said to have an out of range value.

Out of range values can result from two distinct causes.  An out of
range value can be actually present as a SoundFont generator value, or
the out of range value can be the result of the summation of
instrument and preset values.

Out of range values should be handled by substituting the nearest
perceptually relevant or realizable value.  SoundFont compatible banks
should not be created with out of range values in the instrument
generators.  While it is acceptable practice to create SoundFont banks
which produce out of range values as a result of summation, it is
undesirable and should be avoided where practical.


10.6  Missing Required Parameter or Terminator

Certain parameters and terminators are required by the SoundFont
specification.  If these are missing, the file is technically not
within specification.  If such a problem is detected at load time, the
file may optionally be rejected as structurally unsound.  If detected
at run time, the instrument or split for which the required parameter
is missing should simply be ignored.  If this causes no sound, the
coresponding key-on event is ignored.


10.7  Illegal enumerator

Certain enumerators are illegal in certain contexts.  For example, key
and velocity ranges must be the first generators in a layer or split,
instruments are not allowed in splits, and sampleIDs are not allowed
in layers.  If such a problem is detected at load time, the file may
optionally be rejected as structurally unsound.  If detected at run
time, the enumerator should simply be ignored.


                        11  Silicon SoundFonts

11.1  Silicon SoundFont Overview

A OSilicon SoundFont BankO  is an implementation of a SoundFont
compatible bank realized in non-volatile memory with slight format
additions.  On initialization of a system using a Silicon SoundFont,
the host processor navigates the Silicon SoundFont ROM format in
sample memory space, determines the number of SoundFont Banks
installed, and, when appropriate, reads the articulation data of the
SoundFont files out of the Preset Data Chunks into its local RAM.  The
sample headers in the Silicon SoundFont point to the sample address
offsets relative to the start of the Sample Chunk in the SoundFont
compatile bank.  The loader adds the appropriate offset to the sample
addresses as part of its data management.  Then, the system operates
like any other SoundFont compatible system.

The format of a Silicon SoundFont file intended to be burned into non-
volatile memory is a hybrid between a standard ROM header and a
modification of the standard SoundFont compatible bank  file format.
The ROM header contains data used for diagnostic tests, a ROM name, a
size, and checksum information, and a sine wave sample to test audio
outputs of a circuit.  This is the first block of data found in the
SoundFont ROM (address 0).  The structure of the data contained in the
ROM header is shown below.

Because sample mamory space is word oriented, the endian nature of the
resulting word reads is processor independent.  However, the
ogranization of bytes within a word, or words within a doubleword may
vary on both the way the data has been encoded in the ROM and the
endian nature of the processor.  To handle all eventualities, it is
recommended that the initialization software recognize and adapt for
endian variations.

    DWORD romRsrc;           // unused
