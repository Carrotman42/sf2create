
This is a project aimed at better understanding the SF2 format, aka the format
that represents a Sound Font for Midi synthesization. The specification for the
format is found in the AF2_00A files (in a Microsoft Word compatible as well as
split across two text files).

Right now all that is supported is reading in an SF2 file and dumping the
contents, but eventually I hope to create a tool to extract the samples from a
provided SoundFont and even creating SoundFont files from a set of samples.
